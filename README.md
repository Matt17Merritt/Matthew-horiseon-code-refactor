### Matthew-horiseon-code-refactor - Deployed Homework Assignment

## Overview

Upon review of this project, the reader will find an overhaul of the source code that includes semantic elements in the html file, alt tags associated with images to improve accesibility to users, and a css stylesheet that has been rid of redundancies and overlapping classes/ids. The formatting of both the html and css has been changed to better line up with eachother in order to increase readability and allow for future changes. Finally, comments have been added to both the html and css detailing what has been refactored and how the website operates.
